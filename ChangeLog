	* 4.2.1-1 :
	Initial plone-zeo package, changes from previous AUR plone packages:
	 - ZEO Client/Server configuration, which has several advantages 
	 - change to a root install for production use
	 - install location is /opt/Plone (instaed of /opt/Plone/Plone)
	 - added dependencies for Plone to use system libraries
	 - added a 'systemd' unit file
	 - adapted the rd.d init script to use 'sudo -u plone' (instead of 'su')
	 - upon package removal Plone gets uninstalled (not just the Unified Installer)
	 - important site data files are backed up before removing Plone
		
	
		
# for a quick update: change 'pkgver' in PKGBUILD, run 'makepkg -g' and update md5sums
